		<h3>Core Principles</h3>
		<article>
			<p>💯 Design principles are fundamental guidelines that help create effective, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing designs. These principles include balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity. Good design not only looks appealing but also functions well and communicates clearly with the intended audience.</p>
			<p>Understanding and applying these principles consistently across all design projects ensures coherence and professionalism. Whether working on web design, print materials, or product interfaces, these foundational concepts remain relevant and essential for creating successful visual communication.</p>

		<h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
		<p>This color combination demonstrates poor accessibility practices. Proper color contrast is essential for ensuring that content is readable by people with visual impairments, including color blindness. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Designers must consider accessibility from the beginning of any project to create inclusive experiences for all users.</p>
